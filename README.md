# Infiniband-Exporter
Prometheus exporter for a Infiniband fabric. This exporter only need to be installed on one server connected to the fabric, it will collect all the ports statistics on all the switches.

Metrics are identified by type, port number, switch GUID and name. The remote connection of each port is also collected. Thus each metric represents a cable between 2 switches, or between a switch and a card in a server. 

When a node name map file is provided, it will be used by `ibqueryerrors` to put a more human friendly name on switches. 

This exporter takes 3 seconds to collect the information of 60+ IB switches, and 900+ compute nodes. The information takes about 7.5MB in ASCII format for that fabric.

## Requirements

* python3
* prometheus-client (need to be installed with pip)
* ibqueryerrors

## Usage
Metrics are exported on the chosen HTTP port, events like counter reset will be on STDOUT. 

```
usage: infiniband-exporter.py [-h] [--port PORT] [--can-reset-counter]
                              [--from-file INPUT_FILE]
                              [--node-name-map NODE_NAME_MAP]
                              [--ca_name CA_NAME] [--verbose]

Prometheus collector for a infiniband fabric

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --port PORT           Collector http port, default is 9683
  --can-reset-counter   Will reset counter as required when maxed out. Can
                        also be set with env variable CAN_RESET_COUNTER
  --from-file INPUT_FILE
                        Read a file containing the output of ibqueryerrors, if
                        left empty, ibqueryerrors will be launched as needed
                        by this collector
  --node-name-map NODE_NAME_MAP
                        Node name map used by ibqueryerrors. Can also be set
                        with env var NODE_NAME_MAP
  --ca_name CA_NAME     ibqueryerrors ca_name for different infiniband ports
  --verbose             increase output verbosity
```
## Daemon configuration
When using the RPM, some parameters can be set in a file so systemd will pass them to the daemon (`infiniband-exporter`).

```
cat /etc/sysconfig/infiniband-exporter.conf
NODE_NAME_MAP=/etc/node-name-map
CAN_RESET_COUNTER=TRUE
```

## Metrics

InfiniBand exporter metrics are prefixed with "infiniband_".

### Channel Adapter (CA) and Switches

For a better readability the counter metric names are shown here in upper camel case.  
But when exported the names are displayed in lowercase and the suffix "\_total" is appended.
